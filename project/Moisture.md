Moisture Sensors Setup

The moisture content in soil, in the infiltration process, is of great interest in various areas of science. This provides information that allows determining part of the physical characteristics that characterize a type of soil, which is why a large number of studies have been done on this topic.

However, an issue that has not been addressed as much, is the one that involves the relationship between the moisture content of a bedrock and the size distribution of the particles that compose it.

In this work, we address starting up a system that allows to measure the moisture of porous bedrocks, made up of particles of the same size, and of porous bedocks with a size distribution made up of bidisperse mixtures, that is, with two particle sizes. For this work, Ballotini spheres are used as test material.

The system consists of a vertical column, which has moisture sensors arranged at different heights, which output a voltage to a programmable data acquisition and monitoring system cDAQ in a LabVIEW environment, which allows data to be viewed using an HMI.
