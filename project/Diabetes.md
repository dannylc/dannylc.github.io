Hospital Readmissions

A hospital readmission is an episode where a patient who had been given discharge from a hospital is admitted again within a specified time interval. Readmission rates have been increasingly used as an outcome measure in health services research and as a quality benchmark for health systems. The idea of this project is to predict if a patient with diabetes will be readmitted to a hospital based on various features from a dataset of 10 years of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. In this project, a state of the art review was carried out, to know what has been done on the matter. Then, the data for the project was collected and explored. A Random Forest Classifier was trained, finding that the features with the highest importance are the number of laboratory procedures, number of medications, time in hospital, number of impatient visits, number of procedures other than lab tests, discharge disposition and number of diagnoses. Finally, some future work is given to improve the performance of the classification.
