PV/T Optimization

Photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems are combined photovoltaic and thermal systems. These present a better performance than the obtained from the photovoltaic and thermal systems individually, since the photovoltaic part works at a more adequate operating temperature. These systems are specially useful where both types of energy are required, for instance, in the electrowinning process in mining.

The electrical and thermal power obtained from the PV/T systems, can be controlled through control strategies. This workâ€™s proposal is to perform the optimization in the electrical and thermal power obtained from these systems, through optimizing control strategies.
