RFID Sensors Setup

RFID or Radio Frequency Identification is a remote data storage and retrieval system that uses devices called RFID tags, cards, or transponders. The fundamental purpose of RFID technology is to transmit the identity of an object (similar to a unique serial number) using radio waves. RFID technologies are grouped into so-called Auto ID (automatic identification).

RFID tags are small, sticker-like devices that can be attached to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person. They contain antennas to allow them to receive and respond to radio frequency requests from an RFID emitter-receiver. Passive tags do not require internal power, while active tags do. One of the advantages of using radio frequency (instead of, for example, infrared) is that no direct vision is required between emitter and receiver.

In this work, Chafon RFID sensors are configured, in C# language, connecting the records to a database.
