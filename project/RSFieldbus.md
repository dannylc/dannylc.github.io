RSFieldbus Setup

FOUNDATION Fieldbus is a bidirectional, fully digital communication system, which has among its most relevant advantages the reduction of wiring compared to traditional networks, being able to carry out control in the field — instead of doing it in equipments such as PLC—, and a greater amount of information available, helping to detect fault conditions before they cause a bigger problem.

This project consists of configuring the local controllers of the field devices of the 3-series tank plant available at the Control Laboratory of the University of Concepción, and then implementing a level control of the tanks. This includes the complete configuration of the plant's Fieldbus network. In addition to configuring local controllers, configuring network monitoring tools is done.

Rockwell's RSFieldbus software is used to make the configuration. More details can be found at [this github repository](https://github.com/dannylc/RSFieldbus)
